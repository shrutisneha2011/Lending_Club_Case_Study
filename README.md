# Lending Case-study using EDA

## Business Understanding

You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

    If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

    If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 

The data given below contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


Lending loan to applicants those are risky could be a large source of financial loss when the borrower refuses to pay back.
In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

### Loan accepted:
If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios:

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (principal amount + interest rate).
Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments.
Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time and has defaulted on the loan.

Loan rejected:
The company rejects the loan application.

such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
